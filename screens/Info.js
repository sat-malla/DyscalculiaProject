        The main feature of this app is the Single Player Games. Currently,
        there are six fun and exciting challenge games with different levels of
        difficulty. There is no need to go through all the games in order, or
        complete every single game. If you find yourself struggling with a
        mathematical concept, simply press the respective game, and start the
        challenge! Every single player game as a information/tutorial page, a
        normal game page, and the challenge. You first start on the information
        page where you can watch the necessary tutorial videos for the game.
        After you correctly answer 10 problems, you may move on to the challenge
        problems. If you correctly answer 10 challenge problems, you have
        completed the game! You may also complete the game however many times
        you would like. Any time you feel stressed or anxious about a game,
        simply press ‘Quit Game’ on the top left corner. In the future, there
        will be multiplayer games, and way more single player games based on
        difficulty and age level!

        Hey there! I am a high school junior residing in California. App
        development is one of my passions, and I love to spend my free time
        working on some small app projects for fun. I wanted to build LearnCulia™
        because there aren’t many great tools out there that really support and
        encourage young students who struggle with dyscalculia to solve math
        problems with the development of necessary skills. In this app, I want
        to make sure that everyone gets an opportunity to access a fun
        environment to hone their skills. You are welcome to contact me below if
        you have any questions!
